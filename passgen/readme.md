# Welcome to PassGen! 🎉

PassGen is a password generator built with React. It's designed to help you create secure, random passwords in a jiffy.

## What is PassGen? 🧐

PassGen is a simple  tool that generates random passwords. It's built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The passwords generated by PassGen can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. You can customize the length of the password and choose whether to include numbers and symbols.

## How does PassGen work? 🤔

PassGen uses JavaScript's built-in `Math.random()` function to generate random characters from a predefined list. These characters are then concatenated to form a password.

Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. We define a string `str` that contains all possible characters for the password.
2. We define two additional strings `sym` and `num` for symbols and numbers.
3. We create a function `genPassword` that generates the password.
4. Inside `genPassword`, we use a for loop to select a random character from `str`, `sym`, and `num` (if symbols and numbers are included) for each character in the password.
5. The selected characters are added to the password string `pass`.

## How to use PassGen? 🚀

Using PassGen is super easy:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `passgen` folder.
3. Run `npm start` to start the application.
4. You'll see a user-friendly interface where you can specify your password preferences.
5. Click the 'Generate' button to generate your password.

## Wrapping up 🎁

We hope you find PassGen useful in your quest for secure passwords. Remember, a strong password is the first line of defense in data security. Sta
