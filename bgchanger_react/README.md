# React Color Changer

This is a simple React application that changes the background color of the page based on button clicks.

## Project Structure

The main component is `App.jsx`, which maintains the state of the background color and renders three buttons. Each button corresponds to a different color.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Click on the buttons to change the background color of the page.

## Features

- Three buttons that change the background color to green, red, or blue.
- The color change is animated for a smooth transition.

## Future Improvements

- Add more color options.
- Allow users to input custom colors.
